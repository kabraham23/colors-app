# Color Me React

A React App to demonstrate an update of a depricated code base. I used an old tutorial from a Udemy course I bought in 2020. As we all know, we probably won't be walking into a fresh code base. 

There is seed data for 9 different palattes initially. Users can see colors within those palettes as well as alter the shading, copy and paste hex, rgb, and rgba codes for use elsewhere. Users can also create their own palettes. Colors in new palettes can be sorted by drag-and-drop. New palettes will be savedin local storage for use anytime (as long as your cache is persistent.)

Thank you for looking!
